# SOM

This is an implementation of a Kohonen self-organizing map in Rust. Special
thanks to the tutorial at http://www.ai-junkie.com/ann/som/som1.html.

N.B. This is one of my first non-tutorial Rust projects. I'm still learning,
thus this project is likely not very idiomatic, though it should improve over
time.

The SOM is split in to a seperate lib and the rendering is done as an example of
usage. Rendering is done with Piston using Open GL.
